# Java Collections Framework üìö

This repository demonstrates the usage and implementation of key components of the **Java Collections Framework**. It includes examples, explanations, and code snippets to help you understand how different collections work, along with their advantages and common use cases.

## üìÅ Included Collections

Each folder in this repository contains examples and explanations related to a specific collection or interface:

| Collection/Interface | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **ArrayList**        | A resizable array implementation of the List interface. Allows fast random access and is ordered by index. |
| **HashMap**          | A key-value map that uses hashing. Does not guarantee order of keys. |
| **HashSet**          | A set implementation backed by a HashMap. Does not allow duplicate elements. |
| **LinkedHashMap**    | Extends HashMap with predictable iteration order (insertion order). |
| **LinkedList**       | A doubly linked list implementation of List and Deque. Allows fast insertions and deletions. |
| **List**             | An interface that represents an ordered collection. Implemented by ArrayList, LinkedList, etc. |
| **Map**              | An interface that maps unique keys to values. Implemented by HashMap, TreeMap, etc. |
| **Queue**            | Represents a collection designed for holding elements prior to processing. Implemented by LinkedList, PriorityQueue, etc. |
| **Stack**            | A last-in, first-out (LIFO) stack of objects. Legacy class replaced by Deque in modern usage. |
| **TreeMap**          | A Red-Black tree-based implementation of the Map interface. Maintains sorted order of keys. |
| **Vector**           | Synchronized resizable array. Legacy class, mostly replaced by ArrayList in modern use. |

## üí° How to Use

Each folder contains:
- Sample Java programs
- Common operations
- Real-world use cases
- Comments for clarity

To explore, simply:
1. Open any folder (e.g., `ArrayList`)
2. Review the `.java` files inside
3. Run the code using your favorite Java IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code)
